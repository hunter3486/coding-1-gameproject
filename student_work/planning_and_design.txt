Part I: Planning & Design (15 pts)

* Decide on a game idea and core goal
* Game rules and player actions are written or sketched out

* Sketch a simple plan showing how the game will work step-by-step



Game Idea: Mariano The Pirate (similar game to super mario)

Game Rules: 
- Winning conditions: Clear the level/obstacle get the gold at the end by the time limit given
- Losing Conditions: 
    - Get hit by shark = lose. get hit by gold fish or sea urchins (if power up is active you lose it, if not you die)
    - Time limit reached
Player Actions: 
- Fight, running/walking, get tools/items buff or debuff, defeat enemies
Main Objects:
- The player, obstacles, time limit = 2 mins, (lasts for 5 seconds)items(peg leg(buff=extra speed), poison scurvy(debuff=slows you down)), enemies(sharks, sea urchins, goldfish), gold
